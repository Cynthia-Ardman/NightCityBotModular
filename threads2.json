One day 5 cars all rush the shop and a group of thugs called the Dune Dogs burst out and rush the place, looking for any doc that could help....MY GRAMPS!!!! Jacks ends up saving this gramps fellow’s life and getting him healed, but all while Jacks was operating on him he was awake. And Gramps would talk Jacks’ ear off, talking back and forth slowly becoming friends overtime,after the operation and all the Dune dogs watching, cheer and wag their tails at seeing Gramps would pull thru, the old man thanks Jacks for his work and offers jacks an opportunity to be their ranks , be a Dune dogs, ba the designated doctor and have a home\nAnd before Jacks can answer, Grembley yells out \"Yes they are!\" As they smile at ya, showing that they want Jacks to move on. Grembley says that this was too much for their old heart and they thought it would be best if they just made their clinic into a shop for meds. Less stressful that way.",

Murphy | “ECH-0 3”\n\n\nAge: Ninety-Three (Chronologically) | Early Fifties (Physically)(08/24/1985)\n\nPronouns: He/Him\n\nOccupation: Bartender by trade, Soldier-for-Hire by necessity. Psychological Profile: \n\n    Keith M. Murphy is seemingly a calm, humble, and some would dare say, meek old man. He treats those who enter the bar with respect and kindness, and almost never speaks up for himself unless he has to, opting to let things simply bounce off his skin. However, when the wrong buttons get pushed, some claim he’s purposely holding back, his white, clenched knuckles and shaking hands a testament to barely contained anger. When Murphy is behind the mask, though, things change. On the ‘job’, all the contained rage and spite get put into his work, and he becomes a different man entirely; A man that Murphy wanted to stay buried. Physical Description: \n   Physically, at a glance, Murphy looks pretty typical for an athletic man in his early sixties. However, with a closer look, one could tell that, while he may be a little flabby looking in some places due to what the rejuvenation treatments and steroid cocktails couldn’t fix, he’s actually in a lot better shape than one would expect. His muscles are firm, his body doesn’t groan and crack when he moves, his joints don’t ache, and he can do some pretty dexterity demanding looking bartending tricks. He may not be an olympic athlete, but he definitely shouldn’t be counted out. Chrome/Implants: None. Fully, 100% Organic. Skills/Abilities:\n\n“It’s a nice job, if you ignore the drunkards.”\n\n   Bartending is Murphy’s current job, so he’s gotten pretty good at it. “A little birdie told me…”\n\n   Rumor Spreading. As a bartender, Murphy is able to spread rumors pretty quickly. One specific rumor he likes to spread is of a lone merc up for hire. Little does anyone know, he’s talking about himself.",

This also works in getting people off his tail. “You never forget how to do what they taught you | Beware an old man in a profession where men die young.”\n\n     Murphy was a soldier. He was a soldier for two decades, and a contractor for another two. Despite how much he would love to just sit down and forget that part of his life, he knows deep down that killing, whether it be with a rifle, a knife, or even his hands, it’ll always be what he’s best at. “These fucking drugs’ll kill me before any gangbanger does.”\n\n    Not quite as much a skill as the others are, but Murphy knows he can’t keep up with augmented people with just the body he has, despite being in the best shape he’s been in in decades thanks to rejuvenation treatments he won. So, instead, he takes drugs. A cocktail of something (Even he barely understands it) that, while it doesn’t nearly equal the effects of full-on chrome, it helps make up the difference enough to the point where he can survive, and hey, it even helps him put on some muscle. He just won’t be punching holes in concrete like some.",

        "content": "**MedusaCascade**: Weaknesses: \n\n“I’m too old to die young and leave a handsome corpse.”\n\nMurphy is old. He knows this. Even with his rejuvenated and far above average athletic state, he’s still very well in his sixties, and drugs that make him stronger and faster for a short time aren’t going to stop that. Direct punches to places like his kidneys, liver, and head hurt more, he’s prone to worse bleeding due to thinning blood, he takes longer to heal. Things like this should be signs to him that he shouldn’t be forcing himself to live this hidden life, but he doesn’t have a choice. “Look, I know it's old, just give me ten minutes to reboot it. It’ll be fine, stop arguing with me.”\n\n    Murphy uses old tech, stuff that was used in the 40’s. His Exo-Skeleton, for example. While it still does its job of amplifying his strength and allowing him to keep his endurance up, (alongside the Steroids), any experienced netrunner can easily bypass the outdated security systems and shutdown, reboot it, etc. And he adamantly refuses to upgrade it. He doesn’t like change. “Emergencies and jobs only, Murphy. Don’t grab it. You don’t need it.”\n\n    The drugs Murphy takes aren’t without their drawbacks. Strength comes with a cost, obviously. It just so happens that the cost when the drugs wear off include, but are not limited to, Vomiting, Shakes, Fever, Pain, Night Sweats, Nightmares, Insomnia, Dizzy Spells, High Blood Pressure, Disorientation, Loss of Consciousness. Oh, and it's very addictive. Who doesn’t like to feel powerful? _ \n“‘Get some Chrome’? What the fuck are you talking about?”    \n\n    Murphy refuses to update. The things he says, be it idioms, phrases, even jokes, tend to just confuse the newer generations within Night City. Even the way he dresses; Nice, Tidy, Functional. He stands out when he’s not in his gear. Growing up nearly a century ago will do that. And standing out in Night City, nine times out of ten, is almost never a good thing. “Techno-Phobe?",

Growing up in Cold-War era Boston, Under the Big Four’s Government, was rough on the boy, joining an Italian gang by the ripe age of 15. Murphy wasn’t a bad kid, just didn’t know what he wanted to do with life. That is, until the Big Four’s Government decided that a war- No, an invasion was exactly what they needed to solidify their rule. Murphy, at the age of seventeen, was drafted by the U.S. Army in 2002, as the U.S. Prepare for war. He didn’t get sent to the infantry, though. Due to Murphy’s extensive, and somewhat violent, criminal background, he and others with particular sets of skills were selected from his school to be planted within the U.S. Army’s Seventh Special Forces Group, and were sent to South America to do the Big Four’s bidding. New Vietnam, Murphy and the others called it. It was a shitshow, trudging through South American Jungles, killing in the name of a Government that didn’t give a rat’s ass about them.",

And they lost. The war was a shit show. Thousands upon thousands of US Soldiers lost, and they only got the Panama Canal out of it. Murphy, like the entirety of the U.S. Military, were furious. Seven- Almost eight- years of wading through mud and blood, bleeding and dying for the gangs that ran the country, and for what? A water passage? Then, when the rest of the Military left, the government abandoned all their civilian Contractors- Hundreds of Thousands- in the Canal. The Nomad March of ‘10 ensued a few months after. What Murphy didn’t tell anyone, was that he and the others of the 7th SFG left New Vietnam a year earlier to prepare for a disguised attack on The Crystal Palace, A Space Station meant for the rich and powerful, for the FIA, his unit having been taken over by the agency covertly and permanently. Only twenty-three years old, and disguised as a terrorist, Murphy and the others boarded a ship inbound for the high-end space station. It was a massacre. Murphy, and less than fifteen others that weren’t captured, barely made it back to their ship. And the Palace dropped a fucking meteor off the coast of DC, in retaliation.",

The thing he knew, however, Murphy and the rest of the US ARMY 7th SFG were kicking down doors for the FIA, hunting down and executing remnants of the Big Four that escaped the reforms in 2008. If you can get him to talk about it, he’s likely to say something along the lines of ‘he doesn’t remember’. Likely due to the amount of experimental drugs the FIA had them on to keep them awake and fit for combat. Things calmed down after he got home, at least, until the states seceded from the Union, and then, for those “Free States” everything collapsed. Murphy watched from the outside as chaos reigned in those places, people turning on eachother, gangs gathering power. It horrified him. Unfortunately, He was called in to exercise Martial Law. Fast Forwarding to 2020, and Murphy was doing Covert Operations against the EEC in Columbia. When he got back in 2021, however, he retired. A favor had been owed to him by someone in the FIA, and he used it to not only get an Honorable Discharge, but a contract as, essentially, a privately contracted soldier in Militech. And it was good for him, a well paying job for far less danger. Until Arasaka began launching attacks on Militech operations, and they retaliated. Not even a year of peace was allowed to Murphy, now thirty-six, before he was engrossed in another war, and this time, it was privatized. Raids on and firefights with Arasaka forces were extremely common in the fourth Corporate war. He wasn’t inside Arasaka tower when it blew, obviously, or he wouldn’t be here. Although, until 2025, he was contracted by the US to quell Arasaka’s forces. After Murphy’s time in Militech, things settled down, and for once in his life, things were calm.",

        "content": "By 2060, Murphy was seventy-six, and had been serving as a bartender for about thirty-three years, since 2044, living through every major event since then (Such as the unification Wars), as a simple bartender. He even had a partner for two decades while he made ends meet with his job as his body and mind aged, becoming more decrepit as, eventually, by 2073, he was forced to retire. But then, something odd happened. Murphy, in seemingly one last stroke of luck, won the lottery in 2075, at ninety. Not just any lottery, mind you. A rejuvenation treatment lottery, as part of a marketing campaign by none other than Arasaka Industries. They promised to return his body to his prime, and all he had to do was sign the dotted line! In his aged state he didn’t hesitate, as the man was, though he’d never admit it, afraid of death. And it worked! By the fourth treatment, Murphy’s mind was back, and so was his body. He felt strong, fast. He felt like he could take on the world once more, another fifty to sixty years granted to him with just these four treatments, and he had four more to go! But then they gave him the bill. They had tricked the feeble old man when he could barely write his name, with a contract. In order to get the next, final treatments, which he had already started, he had to pay them off. Arasaka took the liberty of draining his bank account to start paying for them, knowing there was no way he would say. He did his best to make the money by returning to bartending, entering the employ of a young woman named Valley at “The Black Den” in Night City, but with the meager salary he makes there, it wasn’t nearly enough to pay off the debt he owed to Arasaka, his old enemies, though he still has the job. The pocket money was nice, after all. With this in mind, Murphy, as much as he hated it, as much as he enjoyed a life of peace, did the only thing he could think of to make money. He started fighting again. Not for a Country. Not for an Agency. Not for a Company.",

Calculating. Forgettable—on purpose. Aya is a soft-spoken observer. She speaks when needed, but often lets silence do the work for her. Everything about her seems intentionally understated, except for how she dresses—which hints at something else entirely. A contradiction in fishnets. She reads rooms like case files and always keeps her back to the wall. Trust doesn’t come easily, but if you earn it, you’ll find someone terrifyingly loyal underneath the quiet. Physical Description:\n\nA sleek, androgynously pretty Neko with synthetic black ears and a long reactive tail. Aya is lithe, almost dancer-like in posture. Pale-skinned with a sharp, angular face. Her makeup and outfits lean clubwear—thigh-highs, fitted jackets, heels—but her body language remains introverted. She often wears mirrored shades indoors, more to mask her gaze than to impress. Cyberware:\n\n    Monowire (2 CP): Coiled within a subdermal forearm port, Aya’s monowire is whip-thin, near invisible, and terrifyingly efficient. She uses it like a scalpel more than a sword—quiet, sudden, and precise. Enhanced Ears (1 CP): Her neko ears aren’t just cosmetic—they can pick up whispered conversations from across a club and distinguish audio frequencies like a machine. Total CWP: 3\n\nOptional flare (if you want to expand later):\n\n    Could add a basic Neural Interface or ICE Layer for situational net defense. Skills & Abilities:\n\n    Stealth and Recon: Aya rarely engages in direct combat. She watches. Follows. Listens. Strikes only if absolutely necessary. People Reading: Despite her quiet nature, Aya reads body language like second nature. She knows when someone’s lying, scared, or carrying a weapon. Blade Precision: Her monowire isn't for show—she trains daily. Quick, lethal, and non-flashy.",

Not one she shares anyway. Born to a working-class arcology block in Westbrook, Aya saw early how people disappeared when they got loud. She decided she’d never be loud. Instead, she drifted through the shadows—working odd jobs, sitting in places no one else paid attention to. A fixer saw her once, just once, and gave her a trial run. She passed it clean. No mess, no noise, no evidence. She isn’t rich, but she lives well. She doesn't show loyalty to corps, gangs, or nations. She’s a free agent. A whisperer. A ghosttail. But in truth? Aya wants someone to see her. Just not the wrong someone. Personality Traits:\n\n    Introverted but always watching\n    Low-key aesthetic, but high-effort appearance (especially clothes)\n    Doesn't like surprises, always picks corner booths\n    Secretly romantic, hides it behind cold logic\n\nIn RP:\n\nAya is best as an observer, scout, or intel gatherer—someone who lets others talk while she watches. She’s the “mystery in the club” type. Quiet but not passive. Possible Hooks:\n\n    Someone recognizes her from her past—maybe from a corp experiment or a missing persons case\n    A fixer she worked for went missing—and now everyone’s asking about her\n    A rival neko exotic is trying to copy her look and steal her rep",

Ryan grew up in poverty withvonly his father. His mother died during a shootout between two booster gangs when he was 5 years old. His father went to the Manhattan Combat looting, sometimes for days, to pay the bills. As a young adult Ryan joined the Army of the NUSA hoping for a better life. When the Unification War started in 2069, he was deployed to Texas a commando to raid texan outposts. After several succesfull raids he recieved several medals for his actions and the attention of the FIA. In April of 2070 Ryan suffered severe injuries and 3rd degree burns from a massive explosion during a raid on a texan airfield. He was rescued and immidiently brought to an Army Hospital where the FIA gave him a visit for the first time. Their offer was either work for them as an agent and get a full body conversion or don't join and getting discharged from the military living a life in pain with the injuries. Ryan accepted their offer and immidiently recieved an exotics full body conversition surgery. Right afterwards he recieved intense combat and infiltration training. From 2070 till 2076 he was part of the FIA's strike team. Since early 2077 his new task is being a sleeper agent within Night City borders waiting for orders. **Additional Notes: does not like texans, records of his apperance before the unification war have been deleted by NUS authorities. **Image(s):",

Calculating. Emotionless. Fearless.\n\nHato is the model employee who never allows personal thoughts or emotions to cloud her judgment. She maintains no romantic attachments due to the nature of her work, possessing unwavering loyalty to Arasaka. She views aspects of her job involving assassination and torture purely professionally and takes pride in her ruthless efficiency.\n\nBoth of Hato's parents are alive. Her father still works in the Bioweapon R&D section responsible for the dojo where she learned martial arts. Hato never discusses her true occupation, instead telling others she works in accounting. She loves classical music and often listens to it during combat to enhance her focus. Hato has a cat named Moochie that follows her around at home, whom she leaves with her parents while on missions.\n\nPhysical Description:\nShort at 153 cm (5’0\") with a slender build, Hato has short, practical blackish-gray hair to avoid interference during missions. From a distance, she appears to be a typical Japanese woman in her early 20s, but up close, subtle signs of Arasaka augmentation become apparent.\n\nShe wears basic black clothing, primarily bodysuits, shorts, skirts paired with jackets or tops. Her wardrobe is entirely provided by Arasaka, though she specifically requested fishnets. When questioned by her handler, she simply stated, \"They'll help me blend in socially with people my age,\" although privately, she wanted them due to her father's previous prohibition.\n\nChrome/Implants:\n\nTargeting Optics (Level 2)\n\nEnhanced Ears (Level 1)\n\nCyberlegs (Level 2)\n\nTotal Cyberware Points:\n5",

        "content": "Backstory:\nHato was born Yamato Hato to an ordinary family in Adachi-Ku, near Tokyo. Her father works in Arasaka’s Weapons R&D division; her mother is a homemaker. Hato was quiet and withdrawn as a child, showing little interest in typical childhood interactions. Her father enrolled her in martial arts classes at a local dojo to boost her confidence, where she excelled, dedicating herself intensely to training day and night.\n\nAs she grew older, Hato mastered numerous martial arts disciplines. Upon reaching adulthood, she applied to Arasaka as a bodyguard. Despite passing every test, she was rejected due to her small stature. Observers from Weapons R&D, including her father, noted her impressive speed, tactical awareness, and foundational combat skills from the dojo training.\n\nLeaving the testing grounds, Hato was approached by R&D representatives, her father among them. They offered her a position as an assassin, noting her ideal stature and skill set. After a week of consideration, Hato accepted the offer. Over the next year, she underwent extensive training in weaponry, vehicles, and received augmentations suitable for her new role.\n\nHer first mission—a quick extraction of an asset—began smoothly but quickly unraveled due to faulty intel. Hato hesitated when unexpectedly encountering a heavily guarded makeshift forward operating base. Her momentary oversight and subsequent loss of the asset led to a brutal six-week retraining regimen imposed by Arasaka. She endured relentless physical and psychological hardships, fueled only by her determination to survive.\n\nOnce retrained, Hato returned to successfully complete the mission with ruthless precision. Her handlers praised her clinical efficiency, marking her redemption. Following exhaustive debriefing, Arasaka recognized her as an essential corporate asset, assigning her personal transportation.\n\nReturning home, she downplayed her extended absence to her mother, attributing it to minor accounting issues. Soon after, Hato received new orders sending her to Night City for a long-term assignment. Her directives were clear: gather intelligence, identify hostile entities, minimize eliminations unless unavoidable, reconnect with Arasaka assets, and gain the trust of locals.\n\nAdditional Notes:\nHato remains unaware of the ongoing Arasaka social experiment involving her psychological limits, a project secretly overseen by her father.",

Born into Australia’s East coast, She studied abroad in Japan to become a Netrunner, an opportunity gifted to her after she learned a highly advanced level of C++ and META-LINGUA. As she arrived with no chrome other than her Neuroport, she came under scrutiny as “Poor” but she believed that extra chrome were crutches waiting to be swiped from under her. She looked for jobs across the two nations, but found nothing but people asking for “Experience”. So, she tried the “nobel” route, setting up her own systems and attempts at Dataforts. Even with these solutions, nothing worked. She ended up nearing poverty, and was approached by someone who she had never met before, but knew of her work. They sat for coffee and discussed the current job market, where this stranger offered her a position. A Netrunner. The promised pay was much higher than entry positions for corpos. She thought about it, but finally decided to take it. She took as many jobs as she could, and the pay didn’t come. Weeks past, and while she was thinking she was being scammed and now on a watchlist of some kind, her rent became due. It would put her in the red. A notification arrived on her phone as she sat in her dirty slum apartment. A wire transfer appeared with… Double what the job was supposed to give her. A text appears, “Hell of a job, choom.",

She worked her ass off, finding information, getting paid, breaking systems, getting paid, deactivating bots, getting paid… Then a dangerous job came across. `Disable the Chrome of a Corpo Gronk named “Katashi Heishi” at 01:13 tomorrow night.`\n\nThe job went bad. While she was flawless in getting into the residence without alarm, the intelligence was dated and she came face-to-face with a child walking the halls. She did the unthinkable, knowing it was her or the child, and used her recently purchased monowire to garrotte the child. She finished the job, and went dark, hearing a buzzing of electricity and flash of light from the bedroom of the Corpo. The next day, news started circulating of the death of Katashi and his son, a writer and investigator for Nippon Daily. A large police lookout had started, and her face was plastered on her screen. She picks up her phone, and a barrage of texts she had ignored shine in her face, ordering her to get outside. She leaves her house, and is driven to a nearby civilian dockyard. Her driver, a masked individual, pulls out a tablet, in a secure voice call. Her employer explains that she needs to get as far away as possible, maybe never to return, and that if she looks back, she would never see the light of day again. She was given two duffle bags from the trunk, which contained a fake ID for Night City, A large stack of Eddies, a SMART gun, and food rations. And so started the long voyage. **Additional Notes:** Distrustful of Government authority figures, and Japanese people as a precaution of being snitched on. **Image(s): **",

Traumatised by this Volt left all of what he had left of his gang life and set out to travel to Night City in search of a new home and a new way of life, He had a pal of his called Andrew who worked as a foot soldier for Militech at one of the facilities in the North West region of the UK. Once signed up he would be sent to Night City as there was more need for workers and soldiers as tensions raised in the city . Once arriving in Night City he began to fit into his new role nicely and from there would join as a foot soldier going up the ranks and gaining all sorts of new implants, and spilling blood in the name of the company. Outside of his corporate duties, he intends to wipe out the Triads from Night City with Militech's help. Volt also works at a garage in the evenings and his days off earning extra money to aid him in his day to day. Additional Notes: The Exo suit provides high endurance when running due to the gear he is wearing, whist also bolstering his strength in his lower limbs",

His belief: do what must be done to spread the message “A finger up the ass of every corp sucker”\nPhysical Description: A wanderer with messy silver hair, round sunglasses, and a rugged, high-tech look. A dark hoodie, tactical cargo pants, and modified sneakers. A massive boombox with a guitar is strapped to their back, blending dystopian survival with a street musician vibe. Chrome/Implants: Steel lungs and vocal chords to increase voice strength and prevent fatigue. Skills/Abilities: Sharp tongue (Able to make allies or gain people trust with my strong words and charismatic personality), Musical Charm (Able to reunite people with music)\nWeapons/Armor/Equipment: My fists, A Dual pistol M-10AF, I wear Reinforced boots, pants and hoodie to protect from small impacts (such as fall, light cuts or fist fights)\nBackstory: Exo Synth grew up in a cramped apartment above a busted-up repair shop, raised by the only family he ever knew—his grandfather, the last to play alternative rock before the corps scrubbed it from the airwaves. The old man wasn’t just a musician; he was a relic of a time when music had teeth. He taught Exo that sound was a weapon, that lyrics could shatter chains. But belief isn’t armor. One day, Exo found him slumped over his guitar, an “accidental” overdose on corpo-brand meds he never trusted. Exo never found out if it was the corps that silenced him or if, after years of fighting, the old man just... let go. And that thought keeps him up at night. Now, Exo is the loudest voice in the underground, spitting raw anthems against the machine, hijacking airwaves, making corpos sweat. But it’s not just about rebellion—he needs to prove to himself that his grandfather wasn’t wasting his breath.",

His voice, the tool of his defiance, is enhanced by hacked black-market vocal mods—dangerous, unstable, but necessary. The irony isn’t lost on him. Some nights, staring at his reflection, he wonders if he’s becoming the thing he hates. If, piece by piece, he's selling himself off just to be heard. The corps have tried to buy him out, dangled contracts promising reach, influence, power. Once, in a moment of exhaustion, he almost said yes. Almost let himself believe he could beat them from the inside. But then he heard his grandfather’s voice in his head: Don’t let them own you. So Exo keeps playing. Keeps burning bright. Not because he’s sure he’ll win, but because if he stops, the silence might kill him.",

Heavy usage of immunosuppressants\n\nPhysical Description: 6 ft tall, Pale skin, white eyes, dyed synth hair, Cybernetic legs, and arms. \n\nChrome/Implants: Mantis Blades +2, Dermal plating +3, Silent step Soles +2, Combat wired Reflexes +3, Cyber arm (Dexterous) +2\n\nTotal Cyberware Points: 10\n\nSkills/Abilities: Expert Close quarters combatant, Tracker, Man Hunter, and sharp shooter. \n\nWeapons/Armor/Equipment: Mantis Blades, Sniper Rifle, Claws, Shotgun, Immunosuppressants and Injectors\n\nBackstory: A former street kid turned tiger claw gangster from Westbrook. Born from a mother who was a Joy toy, and orphaned at the ripe age of 12. Ryuko quickly found herself feeding off scraps, stealing, and finally after growing into a fully mature adult woman joined the Tiger claws. There she skirted on the edge of society, killing, committing petty thefts, and robberies. Only to find herself at odds with a fellow gang member. This rivalry burst open into white hot violence as the same man attacked her then girlfriend one night resulting in the death of both by Ryuko’s hand. \n\nImmediately after the young ex-gangster declared a one woman war on all her former close coworkers out of maddened if not misplaced grief, trying but failing to hunt them down, and took to being a gun for hire. After years of merc work she became a deadly assassin but years of wear is finally catching up. Loaded up on Chrome, falling into cycles of depression, and generally having bouts of psychosis. Ryuko is now on the high road to hell, or a redemption. \n\nAffiliations: A few close friends, and associates. Often uses Joy toys to relieve stress, Meditative classes, martial arts, and frequent visits to a ripper doc. \n\nHobbies: Despite her faculties mostly being gone. She enjoys moments of lucidity telling horrid jokes. Usually involving bad puns. \n\nAdditional Notes: Apex is if you had a chromed up assassin lesbian trying to get her life together. Despite a relatively successful Merc career her past failures still haunt her. Her emotional instability can jump around at random. Going from giggly, to upset at the tip of a hat. Not to mention her constant battle to keep her own humanity is a deeply concerning issue. Taking extra measures to really go about her life, and make some positive changes…When she can that is.",

His pale skin is crisscrossed with faded scar tissue, remnants of countless jobs gone sideways.

Sr. wasn't a noble man, but by God, he was good at what he did—and he taught Junior how to shoot, fix, and disappear before he ever learned to shave. At 12, Alan Jr. was riding shotgun on raids on outlaw nomads, scrounging crashed technology from corps convoys, and swapping bullets for water in drylands settlements. It was a raw, bloody childhood—one smeared in blood, motor oil, and dust storms. Sr. called it \"schooling.\" Others called it endangerment of a minor. But out here, in the Outback Wastes, nobody much cared about laws.",

        "content": "By the age of 18, Alan Jr. was negotiating his own contracts, sometimes with his father—two Autarch's, double trouble. But cracks started to show. Jr. didn't always agree with the scorched-earth methods Sr. used, and after a Coober Pedy job went wrong, murdering an innocent family over a misread bounty, Jr. started questioning everything. Alan Jr. quit at 21 just like that. No great sendoff. Loaded a rifle, a backpack, and headed west toward the coast, after hearing rumors of where mercs might be able to get hired with discretion—the Badlands with along his Crow. The Badlands welcomed him like a brick in the jaw. Nomad packs, gangs, cyber-psycho raiders, and mutated wildlife forced him to adapt or perish in a hurry. Alan was made of sterner stuff than most, though. He made a name for himself building a reputation for fixing trouble on the down-low—taking bounties, running solo jobs, and navigating the wacky politics of nomad clans and fixer-run settlements. And then there was Night City. Alan turned high-risk at 23 to guard a data-smuggler across the border. It was a firefight, a car chase, and an explosive crash in Pacifica—but he lived. There was something about the neon chaos of the city that called to him. It was crazy in a different way. Grime with chrome taking its place, raiders replaced by corps, but the game? No difference. Now 25 years old, Alan Autarch Jr. is making a name for himself in the underworld of Night City. He's a free agent merc—deadly precise, and quieter than a ghost when required. Word has it he has connections with nomad clans in the Badlands and still wears some of the Modern Day Gear, mended with kangaroo skin and tribal burn scars. He doesn't talk much about his past. Doesn't talk much, period. But whenever he finds work, he's fleeing something—maybe redemption, maybe revenge. Or maybe just trying to prove he's not his father's son.

The Nomadic Group despises any form of Cyberware due to it meaning you'd lose your humanity has is prejudice towards the NUSA and USA due to generational trauma; therefore, the teaching was engraved into him throughout his childhood. Around his Teenage years the small Nomadic Group reached the outskirts of Yuma where a local Scavenger Gang happened to stumble on the Group and raided their camp. After discovering they lacked any form of Cyberware their leader gave an ultimatum that they will take \"new recruits\" or kill everyone for enjoyment. The Group gave up some people, including John and then promptly killed all within the camp, excluding the new inductees, including John's Family. Although John hated the Scavs, he had no choice but to learn and adapt. Throughout this time, he worked for the Scavs for a short period of time until he was introduced to the black-market by the Scav Leader where he was also introduced to a dealer that was told he was a \"John Doe\" and a \"Fully Organic\". John ended up learning from the dealer about the ins-and-outs while also getting various Cyberware for the dealer. While patrolling Yuma, he overheard a \"Clean-Up\" operation from a group of Cooperate Soldiers. While making his way back to the Delaers the Cooperate Soldiers began arriving within the area enmass and began telling civilians to either begin paying for luxury apartments or be evicted by force.",

One who does not fear most things and will rush into danger just to have fun. Calm during most situations unless someone trys to take her gun\n\n    Physical Description: 5.6 feet tall dog with brown fur and gold techwear. Chrome/Implants: Kiroshi Low-Lite eys and Militech Paraline cyber deck. Skills/Abilities: Best driver of her clan as well as a decent gunner. Very smart with cars and simple tech. Plus her talents in the bed. Didn't know if that was important so i blurred this\n\n\n    Weapons/Armor/Equipment: Just her trust iron passed down by her Gramps. An old war style 44 magnum revolver\n\n\n    Backstory: Have fun reading this. So Gramps is one of the head chairmen to the clan and the head mechanic, he is the one I lived with all my life and learned from. My dad died fighting off a rival clan and my mom lives with the other side of the clan. The clan will be based out of 2 locations. One where I am and one where mom is, my clan primarily focuses on travel and trade work. Going from place to place picking up new equipment and doing odd jobs for people. Only a select few of the dogs could take on blood contracts. The blood hounds where not special, just those who knew what they where doing and already took a life, easier to take a life when ur hands are already bloody. I was never part of the blood hounds as my gramps forbid it, but I have taken life before. Mainly from a gunk who tried to snatch my ride. At the time it was a treasure to me, but I lost her due to a fire fight. Rouge missile was coming for Paws truck. Him and 3 other dogs where driving the Gun & Runner and I couldn't let them perish. So I lit some flares and drove Infront to grab it's heat signature and then delta'd out only to watch her get hit and be sent to the fires beyond......",

And from there I have been riding with friends, no other vehicle has felt the same so I keep my hands free from the wheel till a new one speaks to me. But hey, I got a new treasure to watch out for and protect. My Gramp's gun, she is a old world iron. Passed down to me to keep me safe while I travel. And trust me, that piece is fucking PREEM!! I have never had an issue from her, not even once. Chambered in 44 means I can hit hard and far, plus ammo is relatively easy to clep so I keep her stocked. My current goal is to head to NC and see what jobs and equipment I can acquire. My Clan let's me adventure on my own and return when I can do to once again. My family (Lov u Paw <3) bit it's thanks to him that I have been able to listen to my calling in life. My main goal is a variety of things, seek out info on the land and possible jobs. Acquired and or clep equipment and supplies for the clan and to most of all...keep safe (Once again, thank U Gramps)\n\nBut yeah, that's some of my story and what I'm after. Names Jazmin Mechanica or Jaz for short. Head Retriever for the Dune Dogs >:)\n\n    Additional Notes: Will always have her gun on her as that is her treasure and dogs don't let go of what's precious to them. Will also be looking so slightly expand her clan and bring people in. Image(s): None yet",

While any OBVIOUS threat would cause her to panic, and she would get intimidated by someone directly threatening her, a lot of the time she's too stupid to recognize things. This applies to things such as common sense, innuendos, and anything subtle. She has a kind enough heart to help someone who might need it, but is highly gullible. She isn't completely helpless though, as given the opportunity to defend herself or escape from a bad situation she will do so.\nPhysical Description: Judith is approximately 5'4 tall with a lean frame. Her hair is dark grey and her eyes are brown. She can usually be seen wearing comfortable clothing like hoodies, sweatpants, or just techwear overall.\nChrome/Implants: Judith has the basic implants that one would expect of a civilian and can connect to any regular port, but doesn't have anything specialized.\nTotal Cyberware Points: N/A (starting amount?)\nSkills/Abilities: N/A\nWeapons/Armor/Equipment: SKULLCO. HIB MK33 Revolver: a revolver chambered in .500 Magnum with 6-round capacity, two barrels, and the ability to shoot single-shot or double-shot. Features internal electronic systems to dampen recoil. The gun is also trimmed/plated with EMI shielding to protect it from ElectroMagnetic Interference \nBackstory: Judith was originally a shut-in who would do nothing but sit at home and play video games, and do BrainDances (BDs). Eventually, either via her parents getting sick of her shit or the landlord- she was kicked out. She is currently looking for work but has no idea where to start, and no life skills outside of video games or pop culture knowledge.\nAdditional Notes: Easily corruptible/influenced, and has room temperature IQ.",

        "content": "Right, so writing this from work so my spelling might be weird and paraphrasing \n\nHow did she get the revolver and learn how to shoot it?\nWhile she did get thrown out, her parents would most likely at least give her some money to make sure she could survive..... Money that she wasted on the revolver and a lifetime subscription for ammo. As for shooting it, lorewise the revolver does have recoil-dampening systems as it is high-end, but I'll be playing her with her not having much experience and LITERALLY just copying shit from video games. Total novice.\n\nWhy's she love video games and BDs?\nWell, when she was just staying at home and not doing much with her life, video games would be the biggest time- killer. Thrown in the Cyberware and BD's that are similar would eventually come up.\n\nWhy was she a shut-in? \nThis isn't one I'd actually thought about, but I do have ideas. I'm either thinking of some horrific case of severe bullying at school, or something that made her not want to go outside, or go to a workplace. (Getting mugged once or almost dying to a Cyberpsycho)\n\nWhat made her parents kick her out?\nShe was in her twenties, unemployed, and not contributing to the household. Basically a \"baby bird won't fly unless it's kicked out the nest\" situation.\n\nWhere does she live now that she's homeless, and how did she deal with that?\nThat's probably gonna be the first thing I do IC, figuring it out. First major task.\n\nWhat does she use the gun for?\nIf getting mugged or almost zeroed by a Cyberpsycho didn't tell her, her parents or any kind of friend would; \"It's dangerous out there.\" Gun will mostly be for self-defense, though depending on how things go IC she might rob people, play with it (she is kinda stupid), and use it if she EVER gets a job that needs violence.\n\nWhy isn't she dead or destroyed if she's so gullible and stupid?\nDumb luck, and that's gonna be the biggest thing IC, see if others ACTUALLY take advantage of her- and have her eventually learn and get better.

His mother tried to shelter him from that life, but his father was a brutal enforcer who expected Dallas to follow in his footsteps. Sheltered but Tempted: Grew up around older Nomad kids who introduced him to partying, fire dancing, and stories of Night City. His Father’s Death: His father was gunned down in a raid, right in front of him. This trauma solidified his fear of violence. Pressured to Become a Fighter: After his father’s death, the clan expected him to pick up a gun and take his place. The Breaking Point: When the clan leader planned a heist on a high-risk corporate delivery, Dallas realized he couldn’t do it. The night before, he stole a dirtbike and ran.",

Never lets people get too close emotionally. Nicknames for everyone: sugar, baby, gorgeous, handsome. Deflects deep questions with jokes or flirtation. 🔥 Stock Phrases & One-Liners\n\"Baby, you keep looking at me like that, and I might start thinking you’re in love.\"\n\"Love’s bad for business, babe. But I’ll make an exception if you make it worth my time.\"\n\"You’re looking at me like I’m a mystery to solve. Trust me, I’m much more fun unsolved.\"\n\"C’mon, let’s settle this like adults—by you buying me a drink and me pretending I don’t hate it.\"\n\"Oh honey, let’s not do the whole tough-guy act. You’re way too pretty to scowl like that.\"\n\nPotential Story Arcs\nForced to Fight: A situation arises where running isn’t an option. He has to choose: fire a weapon, or let someone he cares about die. Facing His Trauma: The flashbacks get worse after a violent encounter, forcing him to confront his past, his father’s death, and his own fears. Making the Cyberarm His Own: He finally modifies the arm completely, turning it into something that represents him instead of his father. Breaking the Cycle: He meets someone who genuinely cares about him, but he has to decide—does he open up, or keep running forever? Reunion with His Mother: Whether accidental or intentional, he’s forced to face the woman he left behind. Does she forgive him? Does he forgive himself? Character Hooks for RP\nPast catching up: Maybe a nomad from his old clan finds him and wants him back (or wants revenge). A dangerous client: Someone too powerful, too obsessed, or too violent. Can he escape?",

Once an ambitious young accountant, she found herself climbing the ranks, one calculated risk at a time—until Arasaka decided to gamble with her life instead. She has perfected the art of appearing calm, even when cornered. Beneath the surface, however, she is riddled with anxiety, knowing full well that her current position is not due to talent alone, but because the corporation owns her. The botched Militech Minotaur deal was her trial by fire, and despite surviving, she carries the weight of that night in every interaction. Now, with a full-time corporate shadow watching her every move, Reina plays the part of an unshakable saleswoman, all smiles and sharp words, but her mind is always running contingency plans. She knows that to slip up even once would mean Arasaka removing her from the equation. One day, she hopes to get out. One day, she hopes to live for herself. But today is not that day. ________________________________________\nPhysical Description:\nReina is an unnervingly attractive woman, her cybernetic alterations sculpting her into a vision of predatory allure. Standing at 5'9\", she carries herself with the practiced poise of a corporate elite. Her body is sleek, toned, and subtly enhanced—nothing too flashy, just enough to maintain effortless elegance. Her most striking feature, however, is her anthropomorphic appearance. After the failed deal with Maelstrom, Reina underwent extensive cosmetic augmentations, transforming her into an anthro-hyena hybrid.",

Her yellow cybernetic eyes shimmer with predatory amusement, her elongated ears twitching slightly with every shift in the conversation. The alterations were meant to be a disguise, but now they are her brand—an Arasaka spokeswoman with the face of a beast, charming high-end clients while keeping lowlifes at bay. Her voice is smooth, velvety, with just a hint of a growl beneath the surface. ________________________________________\nCyberware:\nCyberarm (Dexterous)2ArmPrecision tool use.

Reads body language and vocal inflections with eerie accuracy. •Deadeye Marksman: Reina may not be a combat specialist, but when forced to fight, her HIB-MK33 Revolver speaks for her.

Her assigned security detail, Bishop, is as much a protector as he is a leash. Arasaka will not allow her to act outside their interests. •Not a Fighter: Despite her skills with a revolver, she is no soldier. If things turn into a prolonged fight, she is at a severe disadvantage. •Psychological Strain: The trauma of the Minotaur deal lingers. Loud electric discharges, burning smells, or the sight of malfunctioning cyberware can trigger severe anxiety, threatening her composure. •Expensive Appearance: Her anthro augmentation is not just a disguise—it is a luxury.

His red-tinted visor flickers with unreadable data streams as he scans every room, every face, every movement. His medieval speech patterns make him an unsettling presence, a relic of a failed experiment now repurposed as a personal bodyguard. Despite his towering, cybernetic frame, he moves with the grace of a warrior from a bygone era, ever vigilant, ever calculating. His duty is clear: protect the asset, eliminate threats, and ensure the corporation’s will is done. \"Milady, thou art in peril—I shall carve thee a path of righteous steel!\"\nBut beneath the chivalric obedience, something lingers.

At 18, she entered Arasaka with dreams of security, of a stable career, of climbing the corporate ladder. And she did. By 35, she had transitioned into sales, leveraging her analytical mind and sharp wit to close high-profile deals. She was good at her job. She was loyal. But loyalty meant nothing when Arasaka saw an opportunity. A deal had gone bad. A Militech Minotaur mech, stolen, broken, outdated—meant to be dumped onto Maelstrom to erase loose ends. The original salesman was taken out by a NetRunner attack. Reina was the replacement. The deal spiraled into catastrophe. A Maelstrom lieutenant's son plugged directly into the mech’s neurolink—without safety dampeners. His skull ignited like a Roman candle. Screams, gunfire, and then—MaxTac. Arasaka knew it would go south. They wanted it to go south. They watched her stand in the fire, and when the smoke cleared, she was still breathing. Now, she is their investment. A rebranded face. A fabricated identity. A life owed to the corporation. Reina Arakawa is still climbing the ladder. She just doesn’t know if she’s going up… or if there’s only one step left before the fall.",

        "content": "Name Lilly Raptor aka Lil Raptor\nAge: 29\nPronouns: They/Them\nOccupation: Private Detective\nPsychological Profile: An EX NCPD Detective, turned private eye Raptor having been inspired by their dad (a well known officer) to join the NCPD however their sense of justice is slipping as they try to survive in night city. To cope they built a hobby up of collecting and maintaining retro and old tech and cybernetics fantasizing that maybe night city wasn't always as bad as it now.\nPhysical Description:  Raptor has a feminine build standing at around 5’8 their right arm is an almost antique cybernetic that has a mount to store a small single handed firearm. Their hair is straight maroon and long past that goes past their back. They are normally in some form of suit with an old but well maintained trench coat. They have a form fitting purple mask with a built -in respirator and a heads up display.\nChrome/Implants: Most of Raptors chrome and implants are at least a generation old but have been kept and maintained to a surprise degree of skill. Their Subdermal Grip is built into their right arm and was intended to help with reducing recoil well firing as well as useful as a tool to crush things. The Cyber fingers are built into the end of their right arm normally used to open locks and quickly access computers. The Flashvisor is one of the few things not out of date having had to replace their organic eyes after a nasty flash bang incident well on the job as a patrol officer.\nTotal Cyberware Points: 3 \nSkills/Abilities: With their time in the NCPD they picked up a number of skills which included Investigating and info gathering, basic firearm training and data gathering as well as lockpicking and forceful entry. They also are capable of some basic cybernetic maintenance but most of their knowledge is in older models.\nWeapons/Armor/Equipment: The weapon they carry is a Revolver tho the gun itself is new the design is fairly old. They tend to have some form of protective vest under their clothes mainly intended for stopping up to something such as a small rifle round. In their Mask is a in built respirator that can filter out commonly found hazardous gasses a heads up display that allows access to the net as well as file storage. In that storage is also some of their NCPD files and ID they were able to secure before being discharged.\nBackstory: Lilly Raptor grew up on stories from their mum about how Raptors’ Dad time in the NCPD how he died in the line of duty and how he was a hero. This inspired them to join the NCPD at a young age trying to live up to what they believed their farther was like they attempt to be a hard working and dam good cop however as they rose through the ranks and spend more and more time working in and for night city it became clear that many of the stories they heard was nothing more then make believe. However they wanted to keep up holding a form of justice and try and protect those just trying to get by they gained a rep as an honest cop but this gained a lot of scorn from their peers going against the overall corrupt culture and social norms in the station they were assigned after a few transfers and a number of promotion they became a detective and was working on a case which involved 10 missing people who dissapered at roughly the same time and location. Raptor got close to finishing the case just as all signs pointed to a high standing Militech corpo they were discharged on misconduct and corruption charges. Since then they had to tech to the streets as a Private Eye and sometimes working as a merc in hopes to try and gain enough influence to finish up the case one way or another.",

Weapons/Armor/Equipment: Monowire built into arm, pistol(unsure of make of the model). Virtuality goggles for netrunning. Backstory: She grew up in the northside near one of the maelstroms factories. Her father and mother being both part of Maelstrom died during one of the group's bouts with a rival gang making her determined not to follow in their steps. She was taken in by a friend of the family who is a ripperdoc and learned netrunning in order to leave this section of the city. Due to coming for the northside she was unable to get a job working for arasaka, so instead she took up trading in stolen info and cyberware to survive. She has had no major issues until recently when she was approached by a member of Arasaka to steal a package containing an experimental cyberware from a Maelstrom factory. She was almost killed but escaped with the cyberware and has fled to the otherside of Night City. She's unsure of whether or not Maelstrom is after her but Arasaka might be. She is currently solo and looking to find more jobs. (edited)\n[2:50 PM]\nAdditional Notes:\nShe believes she is actively being pursued by Arasaka or Maelstrom. Due to her last job.

Starting out as a street racer, she quickly became known for her unmatched skills behind the wheel, and for her ability to navigate the lawless, cybernetic-drenched world with ease. Over time, Zuri was recruited into mercenary groups, leveraging her expertise in high-speed chases, infiltration, and combat. Now, Zuri operates as a freelance mercenary, taking on high-stakes jobs that demand precision and cold efficiency, while also continuing to race on the streets for both money and status. **Psychological Profile:** \n\n### **Key Psychological Traits:**\n\n1. **Adrenaline-Seeking**:  \n   Zuri lives for the rush—whether it’s tearing down the highways in her customized vehicle or escaping a firefight with a bullet grazed past her skin. Her heightened adrenaline tolerance has shaped much of her behavior, leading her to thrive in high-risk situations. In fact, it's not just about money for her—it's about the thrill of the chase and the satisfaction of being in control of life-or-death situations. This drive pushes her to take on more dangerous contracts and races, testing her limits\n\n2. **Emotional Guardedness**:  \n   Zuri's life in Night City has taught her that emotions are a liability. Having witnessed the corruption of those around her, including betrayal by trusted allies and the brutal consequences of misplaced loyalty, Zuri is fiercely protective of herself emotionally. She keeps others at arm's length, often appearing cold, calculating, and detached. She trusts few people and relies on her own instincts, preferring the company of her vehicle or her weapons over that of any human connection. 3.",

        "content": "**Survival Instincts**:  \n   Growing up in Night City, Zuri developed an acute sense of survival. She can read people and situations with remarkable accuracy, identifying threats before they even materialize. She’s able to stay calm and think strategically when most people would be paralyzed by fear or anxiety. This has made her a highly effective mercenary, adept at both navigating complex urban environments and understanding the machinations of the powerful factions that run Night City. 4. **Nihilistic Worldview**:  \n   Zuri has a jaded perspective on life, shaped by the constant corruption, violence, and betrayal that defines the underworld of Night City. She believes that the world is controlled by the powerful, the corrupt, and the corporate overlords who manipulate the masses. In her mind, the struggle for survival is the only thing that matters, and morality is a luxury that few can afford. This nihilism manifests in her frequent disregard for the long-term consequences of her actions—she takes what she needs to get by, and doesn't concern herself with the bigger picture. 5. **High Competence and Confidence**:  \n   Zuri’s greatest strength lies in her confidence. She knows that she’s good at what she does, whether it’s racing, fighting, or strategic planning. Her sharp intellect and relentless focus have helped her climb through the ranks of both the racing scene and mercenary jobs. While she might appear cocky to those who underestimate her, her confidence is not unwarranted—Zuri has earned her reputation, and she knows it. 6. **Self-Destructive Tendencies**:  \n   Zuri's need for speed and her reckless approach to danger often veer into self-destructive territory. She’s not afraid to put herself at risk, whether in a high-stakes race or a life-or-death mercenary mission. This dangerous behavior could be seen as an outlet for her unresolved trauma or a deep-seated need to prove to herself that she can overcome anything.",

She analyzes the situation from all angles, quickly identifying her best opportunities and minimizing her risks. This is evident both in her mercenary work and her racing career, where every move is calculated for maximum impact. - **Hyper-Vigilant**:  \n   Always on the lookout for threats, Zuri is hyper-aware of her environment. This paranoia keeps her alert and able to respond quickly to dangers. Her sharp eyes constantly scan for movement, potential ambushes, or any form of subtle threat—whether it’s in the form of rival racers, mercenary employers, or the corrupt corporate agents lurking in the background. - **Physically and Mentally Resilient**:  \n   Zuri's ability to endure physical and mental stress is remarkable. Her years of racing have honed her reflexes, while her mercenary work has made her tough both emotionally and psychologically. In combat, she is fast and precise, able to outmaneuver enemies with ease. However, her resilience is also a double-edged sword, as it sometimes leads her to push herself too far, both physically and emotionally. - **Minimalist Communication**:  \n   Zuri communicates succinctly, often with little fanfare or elaboration. She speaks only when necessary and prefers action over words. This, combined with her preference for solitude, makes her a difficult person to approach. She’s efficient, and she expects others to be the same. ---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nZuri is a complex and multi-layered character—part ruthless mercenary, part adrenaline junkie, part survivor. In the unforgiving streets of Night City, she’s learned to navigate life by trusting only herself and taking control of her fate in whatever way she can.",

Her body is lean and toned, with visible muscle definition, particularly in her arms and legs. Her frame is built for speed and agility, a necessary combination for both street racing and combat. Her movements are swift, calculated, and fluid, reflecting her proficiency in both high-speed maneuvers and precision strikes with her katana. ---\n\n### **Key Physical Features:**\n\n1. **Facial Features**:  \n   Zuri has sharp, angular facial features, with high cheekbones and a strong jawline that gives her a fierce, almost predatory look. Her eyes are an intense shade of grey, often described as cold or calculating, giving her a piercing gaze that makes others uneasy. Her eyes are framed by dark, neatly kept hair that she often keeps pulled back into a tight ponytail to avoid distraction or kept short, though strands occasionally escape to frame her face. Her skin tone is like ivory, marked with a few battle scars from close calls and past confrontations. 2. **Hair and Scalp**:  \n   Zuri's hair is jet-black with a slight sheen, kept relatively short at the back and longer at the front, often styled in a way that complements her utilitarian and tactical lifestyle. The contrast between the sleek style and her intense demeanor makes her look both professional and dangerous. Occasionally, she’ll add subtle highlights of neon colors—primarily deep reds, oranges, or electric blues—to match her racing aesthetic. 3. **Posture and Gait**:  \n   Zuri walks with a confident, measured stride. Her posture is straight and unyielding, giving the impression that she’s always prepared for a fight, a chase, or anything that comes her way.",

They have a laser focus, always scanning her surroundings—whether on the street or in the midst of combat. When engaged in a race, her gaze sharpens, like a hawk focusing on its prey.

After a few years of dedication from being the main getaway driver for any wise guy needing to escape the NCPD or a Capo needing a simple chauffer, Giovanni was the guy. Eventually Bruce Shiv, the current head of the Shiv Family invited Giovanni out to the Falcone Building for a chat. One there Shiv explained a new business venture in the form of racing, a way to provide entertainment and a source of income. Once the deal was made, Giovanni was turned into a made man of the Shiv family and handed a relic from the now revived Scuderia Ferrari racing team. This relic being a engram containing the consciousness of Antonio Giovinazzi, A highly successful driver for Ferrari in the past. Now a days Giovanni can be seen racing through the streets of night city or the dirt tracks of the badlands. Additional Notes: N/A\nImage(s): N/A [For now]",

Weapons/Armor/Equipment: \nRazors discs- They can be thrown and can be called at will, they also can be used in melee combat along with that they can be activated to have them shred targets like a saw. After frequent use they need to be sharpened and maintained.",

After so many years they only go by \"Nightshade\" and nothing more the name they were given by Arasaka Corporation and very rarely give there real name to people; however the missions have gotten more and more difficult and their life is increasingly in more danger they want to try and break the hold Arasaka has over them and live their life free again before they completely turn into the enemy they were sent to deal with and get killed by their own corporation.",

Apex saw potential in Rhys due to his groundbreaking work on **memory rewriting technology**, but when he disappeared, Sabrina became **disposable**. Young, unknown, and alone, Apex saw her as the perfect test subject for their most extreme **bio-engineering** and **cybernetic experimentation**.\n\nHer transformation was brutal and absolute. Apex systematically dismantled Sabrina’s humanity through relentless **surgeries**, **conditioning**, and invasive **psychological experiments**. They redesigned her body to closely resemble a **canine predator**, outfitting her with enhanced **metal mandibles** capable of crushing bone, **cybernetic animal claws** repeatedly installed and reattached, and advanced sensory implants—**SmartEyes**, **Enhanced Ears**, and an **Impulse Splicer**—each calibrated to make her the perfect **tracker and assassin**.\n\nBut her mind suffered even more severely. Apex performed **Experiments**, repeatedly reshaped her **vocal cords** to sound less human, and subjected her to prolonged sensory deprivation (**Tactile Void**) followed by painful reactivation. They chemically rewrote her neural pathways to reinforce predatory instincts, suppressed hesitation through starvation protocols (**Hunger Mode**), and forcibly conditioned aggressive and sexual responses through invasive hormonal triggers (**Breed Reflex**).\n\nResistance was punished with further invasive procedures, breaking her down until no trace of Sabrina Harlow remained. She emerged as \"**The Corpse Hound**,\" a name given by her handlers—because after everything Apex had done, she was barely alive. A weapon, a tool, disposable and obedient. A hound trained to **track**, **hunt**, and **kill** without question.\n\nFor years, she served Apex Dynamics without hesitation, following orders to hunt, track, and eliminate targets. Then one day, the orders simply stopped. No recall, no explanation—Apex disappeared, dissolved or absorbed into something else, leaving her behind. Left with no direction and no purpose, she took the only name she had and stripped it down to a single word: **Corpse**.\n\nShe remembers nothing of her past life—not her real name, not her family, nothing before Apex. Yet the emptiness of who she once was lingers like a phantom limb, impossible to ignore. Now abandoned, she survives in Night City as a **contract killer**, taking whatever jobs allow her to remain invisible, unnoticed, and alive.",

It was a breaking point, a moment that shattered the careful control she'd maintained for years, leaving her **vulnerable and afraid**. In the aftermath, she recognized **Vinny**—a fellow **Exotic**—as her first genuine friend, a frightening yet vital realization.\n\nDespite everything Apex took from her, despite the ruthless conditioning and forced isolation, Corpse finds herself reluctantly hoping she doesn't have to remain alone forever.\n\nYet danger still lurks: If **Lazarus BioSystems** ever discovers she's alive, they will come to reclaim their lost asset.\n\nAnd somewhere else in Night City, her brother **Rhys** might still be searching—either for the sister he **lost** or **abandoned** long ago.\n\n---\n\n# Additional Notes:\n\n- **Rarely speaks unless necessary.** Every word is measured, functional. \n- **Avoids being seen, especially without her helmet.** It keeps her unnoticed, keeps people from asking questions.\n - **Her past is gone.** No memories remain, and none can be recovered. But she may uncover pieces of who she was—not enough to bring her back, just enough to **remind her of who she might have been, what she might have lost.**  \n- **Never fully relaxes.** Sleeps lightly, always on edge, always ready to move.",

Physical Description: Riley stands at about 5'11.5\", with elvish ears and a mustache and goatee. Both of his arms are cybernetic, and he has a faint glow to his eyes due to his optical implants. Chrome/Implants:\n\nGorilla Arms (2 Points)\n\nGradiated Subdermal Plating (Discreet) - 3\n\nBasic Cyberoptics - 1\n\n\nTotal Cyberware Points: 6\n\nSkills/Abilities:\nProficient in CQC, espionage, assassination and intelligence gathering. Proficient with small-arms and sniper rifles, but keeps his equipment minimal to avoid suspicion and allow his own body to be the main weapon he needs. Weapons/Armor/Equipment:\nSuppressed Nue x1\nNetrunner Undersuit x1\nExternal Cyberdeck x1\nCombat Helm x1\n\nBackstory: Riley is a former Intelligence Analyst for the New Unites States of America, currently working as a Private Investigator and Solo in Night City. He was seemingly let go roughly six months ago, and moved to Night City soon after. Together, he and his wife have been running the Nultide Detective Agency, a private investigation agency that the two of them formed a few months after they arrived. However, there may be more going on behind the scenes - something that he may not even be telling his wife about. In reality, Watson is one of several active NUSA Agents within Night City, gathering intelligence on behalf of his government and doing odd jobs to appear to be \"staying afloat\" in the meantime. His wife knows minimal details as to avoid an information breach, but still has suspicions.",

Image(s): Will be added after. Business Form:\nBusiness Name: Nultide Detective Agency\nYears in operation: 0 years, 3 months. Overall Monthly Operating Costs: 250\nStarting Inventory: Unsure what I'd put here for the inventory. Employees: Riley Watson | Arlo Watson (Unsure what character name they're going for yet, still got to sit down and make their sheet) \nRegarding the cyberware, as per the lore and tabletop, there exists subdermal armor that is discreet and doesn't quite look synthetic. However, to balance it out and keep it at a 3, I would suggest that it is less effective at stopping small arms fire than a more obvious, thicker subdermal plating. And with the basic cyberoptics, it would be a stripped down/less powerful version of the \"SmartEyes\" that are in the cyberware list - no thermals or night vision. Here's the current model, but I have additional clothing/replacement clothing that I'm going to be swapping out for some of the gear. Image\nI may be changing the hairstyle as well. Unsure just yet. Currently, both my character and Arlo's character live in the upper floor of the Detective Agency instead of a separate apartment, as we did not have the funds (realistically) to rent two places simultaneously.",

He takes care of the dirty work so they can keep doing what they do helping people, being little heroes of their communities. he'll have been dealing with the sociopathy long enough to be able to mask decently well, so i should be able to play well with others. Backstory: From a charmed life as a Corpo brat to the rising star of the medical field, the child who would become The Rippo Man had such a bright future. Born in 2038 to the Junior Head Assistant VP of Inside External Sales of Militech, he had a pretty great childhood. He grew up a true patriot for the NUSA, his parents saw to it he wanted for nothing, and his education was second to none. He particularly excelled at anything science related, and eventually left for college to dual major in medicine and robotics. He performed his internship and residency at Night City Medical Center, but after a few years decided to step back do something less stressful. He decided to join Trauma Team. There he received extensive combat training before being assigned to a crew and sent out to save lives. He loved the work, but it started to wear on him just how badly some of their patients were injured by their fellow citizen, and he also realized that they only ever seemed to help out the financially aaffluent. After a while, he came up with an idea for his future. He would start up his own ripperdoc clinic specifically to help the less fortunate get the medical care they needed, while also maintaining a small supply of cybernetics to earn some extra eddies to keep the lights on. After a few years, he had earned himself a bit of prestige.",

One day, on the dozenth or so call in as many months to his own personal deadbeat asking about the debt, said deadbeat started getting heated, and stated he was getting sick of hearing from the good doctor, who responded in what he believed to be a joking way \"Look, i'm sick of making these calls, too. if you can't pay for the arm, maybe we should just take it off you.\" The line disconnected, and a couple hours later, Deadbeat and his crew showed up to give the doctor \"what he owes him\", and promptly ripped the doctor's arm off. What followed was a beating that, combined with the blood loss, nearly took his life. Thankfully, the gang decided to show mercy and threw a tourniquet on him before lighting the clinic on fire.",

The fire raged, consuming his life's work and his home, leaving behind so much twisted wreckage. In the following months, his insurance would manage to find a way out of paying him, his clients would find new ripperdocs, and those that owed him decided that since the clinic was gone, they didn't need to pay. He had lost everything dear to him, and he just sort of... snapped. He too what little money he had left and had a couple augments made to himself, and gathered a list of those that failed to pay. He systematically hunted them each down and took back what he'd given them. At first he took care to not do any undue harm, but as the list got shorter, he started caring less and less. Once he had run through the list, he found he'd developed a taste for this type of work. He sold the cybernetics he had reclaimed and used the eddies to fund his start as a mercenary, with a particular emphasis on aiding ripperdocs and medical professionals above all else. He wouldn't let anyone else go down the way he had. Additional Notes: saw is not strong enough to use in combat, used for cutting through bone in surgery/ asset retrieval. Image(s):",

Psychological Profile\n\nWithdrawn, cautious, and highly observant. Jixx suffers from moderate identity dysphoria and trauma due to the forced exotic conversion. Feels more like himself in his current form, but carries a fractured sense of self due to the masking tech and years of isolation. Trusts few, but clings fiercely to people who show him genuine kindness. Prone to emotional outbursts under stress. Struggles with guilt, rage, and a deep desire to feel “real.”\nPhysical Description\n\nStanding at 5’8” with a sleek, lean frame, Jixx is a fully converted fox-like exotic—digitigrade legs, elongated ears, fur-like synthetic skin, a functional tail, and a subtly glowing bioluminescent muzzle. These features are not cosmetic—they’re surgically bonded augments from years of full-body cybernetic alteration. However, when the Echo Skin holographic field is active, Jixx appears to be a slim, pale human teenager with light brown hair and tired eyes. The illusion is imperfect under scrutiny or during glitching (stress, damage, or hacking attempts). Backstory\n\nJixx was taken from his family at a young age by INTRA Industries, a black-site biotech corp specializing in exotic body modification and psychological warfare implants. Dubbed a \"Shifter Project,\" Jixx was one of several children raised in sterile, isolated cells where their identities were slowly dismantled and replaced. INTRA’s goal?",

Jixx was forcibly transformed over years of surgical augmentation—his exotic body not chosen, but forced upon him for testing the limits of identity-based psychological control. The implant codenamed “Echo” was installed late in his development. It allowed Jixx to project a synthetic human appearance—not as a transformation, but as a disguise. He was trained to blend, to obey, and to be a weapon. At 16, an unexpected gang raid on the INTRA facility shattered the experiment. The lab’s wing was destroyed, the children set free into a world they barely understood. Jixx was taken in by the gang who orchestrated the raid—not out of kindness, but as a curiosity and later a useful asset. He was nicknamed “Whisper” due to his ability to get in and out undetected, leveraging his Echo disguise to bypass checkpoints. Over time, he became a drug runner and intelligence asset, climbing ranks quickly—but the stress of conflicting identities and unregulated cyberware began to crack him. After showing signs of instability and a near-cyberpsychotic episode, the gang exiled him. In a blind rage, Jixx returned and attacked their safehouse, leaving several wounded before fleeing. Now, Jixx survives alone in the slums of Night City, selling immunoblockers, black market data, and designer narcotics, while accepting high-risk jobs for assassination, infiltration, and sabotage. His true goal? Find any surviving members of the Shifter Project and unravel the truth of what INTRA did to him. And maybe—just maybe—figure out which version of himself is really real. Roleplay Hooks\nStill has INTRA corporate secrets hardcoded into memory\n\n    Constantly monitors for other “Shifter” escapees\n\n    Can switch between Exotic and human form visually (but not physically)\n\n    Doesn’t know if his body is his or something built\n\n    Collects trinkets and music obsessively as comfort anchors",

How specifically does Raelyna’s PTSD manifest during everyday life beyond panic around blades?,\n*         (Social anxiety, nightmares, trust issues? How does she cope?)\n    1. What triggers might Raelyna encounter regularly in RP (other than blades), and how would she realistically react?,\n    2. Has she sought professional or informal help for her trauma? Why or why not?,\n    3. How do her clients and patients perceive her? Is she respected, feared, pitied, or mistrusted due to her PTSD?,\n    4. Does Raelyna actively seek revenge or justice against the cyber psycho who attacked her? Or does she prefer avoidance and healing instead?,\n    5. Is her ripperdoc clinic known publicly for quality and care, or is it more underground and discreet? Why?,\n    6. What exactly happened to her father after the attack—did he survive with severe injury, retire, or pass away later? How does this affect her daily?,\n    7. Does she have other family or close friends she confides in or relies upon emotionally? Who helps support her emotionally now?,\n    8. Has Raelyna formed any lasting relationships with clients or netrunning contacts, or does her trauma prevent deeper connections?,\n    9. What’s Raelyna’s current goal in life—is it healing emotionally, rebuilding the clinic, confronting her attacker, or something else entirely?,\n    10. Where does she see herself ideally in five years—running a renowned clinic, retiring quietly, getting justice, or escaping Night City entirely?,\n*         The point is not to make you answer all these but to really dive into the character and understand who she is and how she acts and thinks  lol read the last line after I did answer them all so here you go",

She also lives in constant fear of losing her own mind due to her own heavy cyberization.,\n    2. If she is forced to interact with large groups of strangers, she will likely begin drug seeking behaviors. If encountering a blade wielder she doesn't know, any sudden movements will cause her to panic. If backed into a corner she will use hacks and/or try to shoot her way out.,\n    3. What help she has gotten from her family and friends has kept her from losing her mind, but she will not seek professional help because she's afraid of catching a cyberpsychosis diagnosis and being imprisoned.,\n    4. She does good business with the Mox, and other freelance working girls, because she maintains a tranquil work environment and will not tolerate violence or disruption. When she works on solos and other mercs, she prefers to have protection in the form of armed guards.,\n    5. She isn't interested in revenge, and justice doesn't figure much into her worldview as she sees cyberpsychos as victims, and at the same time manifestations of the horrors of the mind of mankind.,\n    6. She doesnt turn away business and she is fully licensed, but her clinic isnt advertised. She works on folk who have trauma or value discretion, by referral and recommendation.,\n    7. Her father is retired now, as he is well into the age of seniority. He spends his time in pachinko parlors and occasionally casinos when he comes into a windfall.,\n    8. She had a good friend and confidant, Vandel, who used to work as her receptionist and occasional muscle, but he recently moved to Atlanta, so she is currently working alone, and in need of a new face.,\n    9. While moonlighting as a Runner she has made a few contacts in the orbit of the Mox, though she doesn't work with real names she does spend a lot of time in contact with Moonlight (M00NL16H7), a runner who specializes in ghosting through ICE barriers and selling information.,\n    10. She wants to make enough eddies to buy her dad a better retirement, and still dreams about taking back control of her life.,\n    11. In 5 years she would ideally be running her clinic in uptown, with bigger and better resources and more stable clientele. She wants to be the destination ripperdoc for the more discerning and less dangerous community. She will however settle for less violent clients.,",

He has a simple, selfish mindset. He does what he likes, when he wants too. He avoids making enemies as best he can, and keeps his cards close to the vest. Physical Description:\n\nKiera is a rough looking man, he hardly takes care of his physical appearance and lives in extreme poverty. His clothes are worse for wear, and he carries very little tech on his person. Chrome/Implants:\nNone\nSkills/Abilities:\nKiera is sturdy in body and mind, it takes a lot of will to live the life he does. He's resourceful, adaptable and good at surviving with nothing but the clothes on his back. He's just at home in the desert as he is in the city. He knows some basic dirty fighting, but he's no expert. And he's got about a similiar expertise with firearms. He's more of a jack of all trades, charismatic survivalist then a specced up hit man. Weapons/Armor/Equipment:\nKiera has a simple pistol overshadowed by a very sturdy k-bar. Backstory:\nKiera was born as an inquisitive nomad in the deserts, belonging to a small family whom he parted from to join another Clan when he was young. He lived a rough, fun, and eventful childhood. Though he was once a bit of a troublemaker, he's since begun to settle down into a calm and more reserved man. He's stepped into the city to learn more about the world beyond the desert. He's confident he'll survive. Maybe a little too confident.",

The statement was made and Arisaka's knee was kicked from beneath them, not crippled but enough to cause them to be cautious. after the raid, tempest would leave the U.S. making his way to Australia, stripping himself of his combat cyberware and acquiring a license to carry. L0-V4 would flee deep into the badlands and in the end faking his death. time later he would return to Night city, his shithole of a home. attempting to say low, L0-V4 would take up the pseudonym of \"Bones\". with whatever funds he had he changed his appearance, purchased new gear and then Buying \"the zen garden\", later renamed to \"the Skeleton crew\" where he began a new hidden life in night city.**```",

Ryker was independent and never tied to a specific faction, making him a valuable asset in the underworld.

His family was told he died in the blast, but the truth was far darker. Arasaka retrieved him, saving what was left of his body and using him for their **Project Revenant**. His limbs, eyes, and brain were replaced with cybernetic enhancements to turn him into a tool for the corporation.

His loyalty is strictly enforced through his cybernetic programming, though he harbors deep internal conflicts and emotions from his erased past. Arasaka treats him as a disposable tool, providing only the basic needs for survival—food, hygiene, and sleep—without any respect or care for his well-being. ---\n\n**Escape from Arasaka:**  \nDuring a mission where Vex’s internal struggles begin to interfere with his tasks, Arasaka sees him as a liability and decides to dispose of him, either by reprogramming or eliminating him. In the chaos of this moment, his desperation and anger cause him to break free, either with the help of an unexpected ally or through his own forceful action. This is his first taste of freedom since his transformation into the Rexoium. ---\n\n**Current Situation:**  \nVex now wanders in a world where he is both a product of Arasaka and a fractured soul desperately searching for his past. He is constantly haunted by glitches in his cybernetic systems, as well as the remnants of his memories and identity. Though he struggles with loneliness and isolation, he is determined to break free from Arasaka's grasp and discover the truth about his former life. He tries to make friends but finds it difficult to trust others and form connections due to his emotional scars.",

He speaks like a chivalric warrior, addressing others as “ser,” “milady,” or “knave.” His flowery, medieval way of speaking can be both amusing and unsettling, especially in the brutal reality of Night City. Arasaka’s mental conditioning forces him to see his work as righteous service to his lord. Deep down, fragments of Elias Kessler still linger—painful memories of a past life, old friendships, and a betrayal he can’t quite recall. His loyalty programming forces him forward, but the cracks are growing. One day, he will wake up. One day, he will break free. Physical Description:\nSir Lazarus is a towering cybernetic warrior, built with reinforced musculature that enhances his strength but not to superhuman extremes. His pale chrome plating is weathered from battle, and his red-tinted visor flickers unpredictably, hinting at instability in his neural interface. He moves like a man still adjusting to his own strength—sometimes too stiff, sometimes too fluid, as if parts of him remember being human while others have long forgotten. Despite his power, he is not unstoppable. His joints and articulation points are vulnerable, and his heavy frame makes him less agile than a fully human opponent. Cyberware:\nSmart Eyes2EyeZoom, thermal, night vision, facial ID, AR HUD.Eyes glow. You sometimes blink asynchronously. Dermal Plating3SkinResistant to blades, blunt trauma, small arms.Feels cold to the touch. Looks synthetic. Scanners flag you.

His style is formal, methodical, and calculated. •    Tactical Awareness: Despite his outdated ideals, he is a brilliant battlefield strategist, reading opponents’ movements with military precision. •    Programming Instability: Occasional moments of clarity allow glimpses of Elias Kessler’s past life, which can either strengthen or weaken his resolve. If his memories surface too strongly, he hesitates in combat, giving enemies openings. Weapons/Armor/Equipment:\n    •    Arasaka Railgun:\nA shoulder-mounted, high-calibre magnetic acceleration weapon designed for long-range engagements. •    Weaknesses:\n    •    Bulky & Heavy: Cannot be fired while moving; he must brace himself before each shot. •    Cooldown Required: One powerful shot before a cooldown period (30–60 seconds depending on charge level). •    Severe Recoil: Requires his reinforced musculature to withstand the force. A misfire or faulty calibration can stagger him. •    Fire Modes:\n    •    Low-Power: Fast-firing suppression rounds (weaker than a standard rifle). •    Mid-Power: Armor-piercing rounds, effective against light mechs and cyberware. •    High-Power: Anti-material blast requiring a long charge time and exposing his position. •    VioTech MechaBappers (Cybernetic Gauntlets):\nA pair of massive, mechanical fists, powered by kinetic energy. These replace a standard prosthetic hand and serve as both offense and utility. •    Modes:\n    •    Brawler Mode: Crushing melee blows that can stagger most enemies.

Unlike mercenaries or edgerunners, he was never meant to fight—until Arasaka made him into a weapon. After an incident involving classified tech, Arasaka forced him into full cybernetic augmentation, stripping away most of his organic body and memories. His programming suppresses his past, leaving only a warrior devoted to the corporation. But cracks in his mind let fragments of Elias Kessler resurface. He sometimes remembers a garage filled with tools. He sometimes remembers a woman’s voice. He sometimes remembers what it felt like to be human. And when those moments come, the ghost in the machine fights back. Personality & Speech Pattern:\n    •    Talks like a knight: Uses old-fashioned speech, addressing others formally. •    “Halt, knave! Face me with honour!”\n    •    “Serrah, thou dost not comprehend the perils before thee.”\n    •    “Forsooth, ’tis but a scratch!”\n    •    Contradictory Mentality: Believes in honour and duty yet serves a corrupt corporation. •    Occasionally defies orders without understanding why.",

Attended Schooling for Cyberspace knowledge and software design for a career in Militech. Following her sisters accident, attention from her parents grew far less frequent, mostly given to Kelly's mental and physical health. Sarah, in a fit of emotional abandonment, began to isolate herself and turned toward undefined cyberspace exploration and experimentation as a form of  catharsis. She turned out to be ahead of a few people in her community of peers, likely from the lessons at school. Not long after becoming more involved with these activities, her grades began to fall behind and her parents gave her a specific, more negative reaction than she'd hoped for. But it was something, and the raw Net was something that didn't feel so bleak and alone. Her initial dives were not so reckless, but as she began to get noticed by her family she became more interested in hanging out with netrunners outside of school, from the street who knew shit the class would never teach her. Like hacking basic auto vendors and tapping store links for secrets and selling the info. On a whim, and some additions of more unsightly company to impress, Sarah took a dive and ventured too the Blackwall with a small crew. After a few hours, a few of them dared her to touch it.",

All Cybernetics and software caught fire inside her body and she 'exploded', for lack of an accurate word. But she was lucky. Luckier than most in Night City have been upon making contact with the Blackwall. After multiple thousands of Eurodollars, three days of anxious waiting interspersed with lengthy conversations about remaining in a vegetative state for the rest of her life, and replacement of all necessary hardware and sever brain and muscle surgeries; Sarah woke up. Sarah was greeted with a mix of reprimand and unconditional gratitude. But she approached her miraculous recovery quite differently. She was withdrawn, emotionally scarred, and easily paranoid. After being discharged from the hospital, she receded and became less interested in diving for anything other than guaranteed safety and necessary work. Her memories were sometimes fuzzy, she was prone to losing focus, and sometimes claimed to hear noises that no one else could. But, her skills with the net were retained. In fact, in most of her work she found a certain simplicity where other runners would struggle. Had she remained interested in the career, she likely would have found promising job offers. However, due to life changes in environment and style, she found that working freelance offers and with Kelly's escapades, there were faster ways to make money and buy the Cyberware she wanted. It's been a few years since the Blackwall incident, and Sarah and her sister have recently moved closer too the area, interested in making a life for herself. Additional Notes:\nImage(s):",

Minimal visible weaponry. Seduction is her defense—and fallback. Backstory Summary:\n\nBorn in Dogtown, Kelly had a rough early life. She barely escaped being Scav bait, only to suffer catastrophic injuries in a chemical explosion during a family outing. Only 7% of her original body remains; the rest is synthetic, leaving her a walking trauma case with a shiny coat of chrome. She attempted to die by refusing treatment—but found something… else. After discovering sex and attention could make her feel alive again, she pursued body upgrades, cosmetic augmentations, and work in the nightlife industry. Her goals were simple: money, comfort, survival—and maybe love. Her life is now one part hustle, one part escape. She uses her body and wits to carve a place in a city that still sees her as a fetish object or broken thing. She enjoys her work more than most would guess—but every once in a while, something cracks through.",

Chrome/Implants: Lynx Paws, Titanium Bones, Rara Avis\nSkills/Abilities: Ability to See in the Dark [NVG/Thermal]\nWeapons/Armor/Equipment: P401, Thompson, Mastiff\nBackstory: Jack Chlotna was born into the cold, polished world of corporate privilege, the son of a high-ranking executive at the powerful Arasaka Corporation. On the surface, his family had everything—luxury, influence, and respect. But behind closed doors, Jack's life was far from perfect. His father, Markus Chlotna, was a man driven by ambition, power, and an overwhelming need to control everyone around him. Jack quickly learned that his father's love was conditional, and it came with a price. From an early age, Jack was pushed to be perfect—grades, behavior, performance—all meticulously controlled. Any failure, no matter how small, was met with cold, calculated punishment. Markus was cruel, both physically and emotionally, using Jack’s every mistake as an excuse to tear him down. His mother, often too afraid to intervene, was little more than a passive figure in their home, leaving Jack to fend for himself in a world where his value was determined by his father’s ever-changing standards. As Jack grew older, the weight of his father's expectations became unbearable. He began to resent the corporate world that had stripped him of his own identity, replacing it with a never-ending cycle of achievement and compliance. At 18, after years of enduring abuse and manipulation, Jack made the decision to escape. He left the Chlotna estate in the dead of night, cutting all ties with his family and the life his father had planned for him. Jack Chlotna is now an enforcer for the Backstreet Butcher Boys, a gang that thrives on brutality and fear in Night City’s darkest corners.",

His skills with weapons and hand-to-hand combat made him a feared figure in the underworld, but it wasn’t until a tragic accident that Jack truly became a legend. During a routine hit gone wrong, Jack was caught in an explosion that left him disfigured beyond recognition. His face was gone, destroyed in the blast, and the doctors couldn’t repair the damage. Instead of fading into obscurity, Jack made the decision to replace his lost face with a cutting-edge Protogen visor—a sleek, high-tech piece of cyberware that not only shields his identity but enhances his vision with thermal, night, and augmented reality capabilities. The visor became a symbol of his transformation into something more than human, a reminder that in Night City, you can lose everything and still come back stronger. Additional Notes:\nImage(s):",

They adored the silence that came after the kill after years and years of noise, shows and stress, however they couldn't bask in the glorious silence just yet. They had to move.

There was no real protections because the guy was an idiot. They sold their old show based chrome, the ones with actual function and replaced it with some more... malicious and useful cyberware.

She always has a habit of breaking things down in her mind and rebuilding it into something new wherever her eyes could touch. Years down the line she ends up working in night city. Making her way into a shop where she was hired by Adrian Gates to work at \"Hephaestus Auto and Repair Shop\" where she works her magic, and that's where our story continues... Additional Notes: The character although is not in Cyberpsychosis, I will be playing them as if they are insane. The range of insanity can be taken up to staff on how I RP. I've been told I can take that dial and turn it a little too far. Image(s):",

He was part of Project ECHO, subjected to experimental brain-machine interface tech known only as the \"OBLYVIAN drive\", creating the ultimate corporate spy. But something went wrong. The drive gave him severe neurological damage that leads to migraines, flashbacks or sometimes blackouts. although Jay is well trained and enhanced, his experimentation makes him unpredictable, a liability. Jay was meant to be erased, but instead, he became something Omnitech never expected: a ghost in the machine, fighting back. Now, Jay is a ronin of the grid, his mask hides his identity while feeding him real-time data. He sells secrets, dismantles oppressive systems, and leaves behind a digital signature wherever he strikes, a neon fox symbol. the last thing his enemies see before their firewalls burn. But Jay knows the clock is ticking. The migraines and flashbacks cause him to struggle, and Omnitech hasn’t stopped hunting him. Every night, as he fades into the city's electric heartbeat, he wonders: is he still human, or just another ghost in the machine? Some Motive/Internal conflict\n\nJays mother, Nora was either abducted or killed during his experimentation with Omnitech. His flashbacks are distorted, showing him glimpses of his mother occasionally but never the full truth, seeing things like a hand reaching for him, a voice calling his name, or the flickering lights of a lab. Was she a test subject like him? Did she try to protect him from Omnitech? Was her fate erased from his mind on purpose? Every mission could bring him one step closer to the truth—or push him further into the mental chaos of his own fractured memories.",

Jay is in a constant state of doubt and paranoia. Every lead, every flashback, and every piece of information he uncovers could either bring him closer to reality or send him spiraling into deeper uncertainty. Defining Moment\n\nAs an elite netrunner under Omnitech Industries, Jay was a rising star, handpicked for an experimental cyberware implant called the \"OBLIVION Drive\". A cutting-edge neural augmentation designed to predict threats, process vast amounts of data, and enhance cognitive speed beyond human limits. Omnitech wanted to create the perfect infiltrator—someone who could see an attack before it happened, outmaneuver enemies, and manipulate systems with near-instant precision. At first, the implant was a success. Jay became faster, smarter, deadlier—a living supercomputer, executing black ops for Omnitech with chilling efficiency. But then, running on a neurochemical knife’s edge started to take its toll, when his implant started to show him things he wasn’t supposed to see—encrypted files, hidden directives, corporate betrayals. Through it, Jay discovered the truth: Project ECHO wasn’t just about creating agents—it was about controlling them. The experiments weren't just enhancing him; it was slowly overriding his mind, rewriting his thoughts, turning him into nothing more than an obedient drone. And he wasn’t the first. He had found files on others—test subjects who had “malfunctioned” when the implants pushed them past their limits. Omnitech’s solution? Memory wipes. Reprogramming. Disposal. Jay realized he was next. The night of his scheduled \"routine maintenance\", he made his move.",

Interrogation \"Tools\" – A customized kit for when he needs to get information out of someone. Backstory:\nVinny wasn’t born into power. He clawed his way up from the gutters of Night City, where survival meant knowing when to throw a punch and when to take one. He grew up around gangs, fixers, and mercs, running protection rackets and settling disputes before he was old enough to drink. Violence was never just a means to an end for Vinny—it was an art. He never killed randomly, never wasted an opportunity. Every corpse had a message, and every message tightened his grip on the streets. That’s what made him stand out. He wasn’t just a thug—he was a specialist. When the power in the Butcher Boys shifted, Vinny didn’t just survive the transition—he thrived in it. He proved himself through brutal efficiency and unwavering loyalty. He took the jobs no one else wanted. He handled problems that needed to disappear. Every time he was tested, he came out the other side, bloodstained but standing. Now, as a Capo, Vinny oversees the muscle operations, protection rackets, and high-profile hits for the gang. He doesn’t care for the politics, and he has no interest in running the show—he just wants his piece of the city and the freedom to do what he does best. And if anyone steps out of line? They don’t just die. They become a warning. Additional Notes:\nDoes not believe in mercy – If you’ve earned his wrath, you don’t get a way out. Brutal protector – Anyone who preys on what he oversees without his permission is marked for death. Respects strong opponents – Killing them is all the more satisfying.",

One could call him eccentric and playing into his Exotic visage with bird like mannerisms and with how His eyes are constantly darting about the room. However in truth this is due to his ever careful nature and always planning an escape. Though should he fail to find one he might start making a scene. One might see him fidget and grow increasingly agitated especially if he is ever seated facing away from the entrance to a room. When excited or really agitated and trying to calm himself one might hear him start humming a tune or two. His past life constantly haunts him almost like a second personality calling him to remember the oath he had taken as a doctor. This gets worse should he ever have to kill someone. This leads him to try and find any sort of non-lethal approach to jobs. **Physical Description:** An exotic among even exotics with extensive reconstructive implants and replacements giving him the look of a walking talking hawk. **Chrome/Implants:** \nExperimental avian styled Bioware from Biotechnica including feathers, a beak full jaw replacement, avian styled hand and foot replacements.

It meant he had done it, he was a doctor now. And with it, soon he could help people, make a difference and earn a legacy that gave all the wealth and prestige he deserved for the hard work and sacrifice. That was then, now to Hawk those words were practically meaningless, nothing more than a nagging ache of a past life screaming desperately as his most recently orchestrated cyberware hack causes the internal CPUs in some attacking ganger’s arm chrome to fry and combust giving Hawk just enough time to make his escape. This past life, Dr. Marstel was a bright new face just out of medical school when he was poached by Biotechnica to become a cyberware specialist with some of their exotic line of Bioware. A good start to earn some good eddies, who was he to pass up a good deal. He could work with them until he could set up his own practice. Finding he excelled with cyberware installation, when he finally made his own way he instead took up as a ripperdoc offering services specializing with ocular, protective, and countermeasure chrome. Now he liked to say he held a reputation on the straight and narrow of a law abiding clinic, however when a man in a suit with six mercs holding irons to your face politely asks you to install some black tape level preem chrome behind his eyes, who was he to say no. How was he supposed to know the tech was swapped by some sneaky edgerunner a few days before? How was he supposed to know that man would suddenly go cyberpsycho in the middle of a back street weapons deal. He was just an unfortunate soul caught up in the middle of some high ganger politics and like most loose ends would find his story pruned before it could blossom. Of course that was only partly true. Word travels fast but not quite fast enough.",

Had Dr. Marstel not dipped into his own supply and self service from time to time he would have flatlined then and there, however a lucky quick hack and some protective dermis in his arms were just enough to barely survive the first salvo that wrecked him as he cut and ran. Close to flatlining with his stims running out, by a miracle he made it to an old work choom and fellow cyberware specialist from Biotechnica before collapsing. He needed to disappear so with favors cashed as payment for exotic reconstructions to replace his destroyed jaw, hands, legs, and Identity. Unfortunately cashed Favors can only go so far, so he has a serious debt to repay. His friend knew a Fixer that could help him with some basic level job but he would have to start getting his hands dirty. While he can't go back to his old life lest he be discovered, he did learn a lot more about the software of cybernetics rooting through them while putting them in people's guts. Knowledge of hidden backdoors and security vulnerabilities that unlock some nasty surprises inside an enemy could prove useful. And he did need the eddies, he literally can't afford to be picky with work and repossession of his chrome would mean discovery. So Dr.Jefferson Marstel's story would end so that Hawk's could start in its place. A new identity, a new story to be written over the pages of what was. Now if only he can keep the old text from bleeding through. He just might survive.",

It owed a lot more than just Eddies for their help saving Hawk’s life. Is one of the few people that knows Hawk’s true identity. Biotechnica - Previous employer he just might still have access to their facilities. Mafia - Totally am clean with these folks and totally not secretly a Ripper doctor that they think they killed a little while ago. Growth potential and knives. A knife is a piece of personal lore(usually negative) that can be twisted by storytellers to add drive and reaction to a character. Still coming to terms with how different his life turned out. His dream of being a doctor and helping people was shattered. How much of a life can he put together with the pieces? Will he find some other way to help people? Will he return to his past life? He was a good ripper doctor. But the fact that his last patient went cyberpsyco after he installed an implant haunts him. Did he make a mistake? It’s a question he asks himself all the time. What would he do if he heard a rumor about a chip that was stolen from said mafia before that operation? Who knows what he would do if he found the edgerunner that stole that tech. He’s gotta get eddies to pay off his debt. Riel got him a connection to Fixer to start some work. How will he take to such a different lifestyle? He probably will react poorly should he have to kill someone. “First, do no harm” after all.",

In between ports, Charles was getting his education from the tattered remains of the Net as it existed outside of major cities. Sure, the Blackwall encircled all, but the infrastructure just wasn't there yet. From the moment he learned about Roche Bartmoss, he was fascinated. Why would someone tear it all down like that? what was the goal? Chaos? Reform? Reconstruction? Whatever the goal, he supposed it didn't matter, since he had to go on the run and vanished not too long after. Charles gathered all the information and education he could, learning every technique his clan's netrunners knew, and learning from anyone he could find in the port towns they would stop at for fuel or gear.",

He'd just tracked down The villainous Netrunner that went by the handle x.X.x.Dawng.L0rd.6969x.X.x., who had recently had the gall to hack in and look at an internal memo in Arasaka's network (turns out it was the menu for the cafeteria for the week). As it turned out, it was an extremely talented kid, about 12, who just made a real bad decision. Charles had suggested just giving them a warning since that would likely scare the bejesus out of the kid and he'd go straight. His boss passed it up the chain, and the word back from Arasaka was to zero the culprit. He was ordered to kill a 12 year old kid. He decided there was no way he would do that, and anticipated how things would shake out from there he made a quick backup copy of the (at the time) bleeding edge software and demons at his disposal, turned his deck in for maintenance and grabbed a loaner from supply, while also secretly socking away a (at the time) brand new top of the line cyberdeck behind the door panel of his car (an old habit from his Nomad days. it never hurts to have a secret compartment or two). When he went to his boss and refused to murder a child, he was mocked, berated, beaten, searched, nearly executed, and obviously fired. Ultimately, the kid was still killed by a (now former) coworker. Trauma Team showed up to get him to a hospital, but his coverage was cancelled en route and they dropped him off in a gutter. Luckily this was near a ripperdoc's place, so he was able to crawl his way in and not die. He spent the next couple weeks in traction, pondering what his next move should be. After he recovered and spent a majority of his savings paying the ripperdoc, and then sold most of his possessions to get the money to get his car out of impound, he decided a little payback was in order.",

In his off time, he would also remove netrunners from the game that were causing unnecessary problems, burning out their net access or their brains. He finds himself thinking about Bartmoss more often nowadays, and he thinks he gets it. It wasn't about the chaos, the destruction. It wasn't about reform or reconstruction. It was about the freedom. Breaking the digital chains the megacorps had put on us all. but now they were being reforged. He just hoped he could use his aging, though still pretty preem equipment to cause enough trouble to keep everyone free before they were done. His last major score before making his way to Night City was a Zetatech R&D Facility, they'd nearly finished work on an upgrade to their Personal Ice system called \"ImmunoAid Plus\", slated for release in 2078. As it turns out, it was just a few lines of code that could be inserted into any ice hardware that would increase it's efficacy at detecting intrusion. His plan is to give Zetatech a long hard fucking by releasing it as freeware through every Ripperdoc he can contact. What better way to make a name for himself in Night City than to be That gonk that's way too generous? (IC it would be the reason people with personal Ice can suddenly see why they're being hacked or it would do nothing mechanically but increase security for flavor)",
